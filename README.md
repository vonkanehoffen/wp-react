# wp-react
## A React + Redux based Wordpress Front End

Pretty experimental at the moment. Used for my personal blog at [https://kanec.uk/](https://kanec.uk/)

Thanks to [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for the foundation. ...even if it was massive overkill for this ;-)

Want a look?
```
npm install && npm start
```
Make sure the [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) is enabled on your Wordpress blog and point to it in `/app/config.js`

There is also a basic deploy script. `./deploy.sh` . Update server URIs accordingly.

:balloon: Have fun! :balloon:
