# wp-react
## A React + Redux based Wordpress Front End

Pretty experimental at the moment. 
Thanks to [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for the foundation.

Want a look?
```
npm install && npm start
```
Make sure the [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) is enabled on your Wordpress blog and point to it in `/app/config.js`

Have fun!
